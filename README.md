# Servo

Servo is a Discord bot that will post the text or image of a Magic: the Gathering card to a text channel when its name is referenced.

## Usage

You must have the _Manage Server_ permission to add Servo to your Discord server.

## Features

While chatting, surround a Magic card names with brackets (`[[` and `]]`) and prepend with an optional token. Servo will print out the text of that card or its image:

| Command               | Function                                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `[[Joven's Ferrets]]` | Show a text representation of Joven's Ferrets.  |
| `[[!Goblin Game]]`    | Show a picture of Goblin Game.                  |

Servo will also attempt to fix misspellings or partial card names:

Magic cards often contain symbols that cannot be replicated in text, but Servo ships with a set of images that can be used as [custom emoji](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/207619737-Adding-Emoji-Magic) to replace them with their graphical equivalents. Discord limits you to 50 custom emoji, so you'll have to choose which ones are most appropriate for your users.

Without manamoji, mana symbols will be shown in braces:
